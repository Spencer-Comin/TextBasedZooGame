Requires Python 3.8+

To run, first install dependencies by running
<i>pip install -r requirements.txt</i> (maybe in a virtual environment)
from inside the repository. Then start up with
<i>python3 src/ZooGame.py</i>.

Alternatively (for macOS only), download the pkg from [releases](https://github.com/Spencer-Comin/TextBasedZooGame/releases "Releases") and install.

Type commands in the text input box, and move around with the arrow keys.
